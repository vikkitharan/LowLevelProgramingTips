\subsection{commit}
Each commits is a story point -- telling the history of the change.

A commit should have a single logical concept.

A commit can be edit, modified or clan up by \texttt{rebase}~\ref{git_rebase} command.

\subsection{Edit a commit}
When I want to edit the last commit, I stage all necessary changes then I use \texttt{ git commit --amend --no-edit} command.


\subsection{rebase} \label{git_rebase}
Once a branch is ready to merge, I clean up the commits -- history of the changes. 


\texttt{git checkout develop}, checkouts to \texttt{develop} branch.

\texttt{git rebase -i master}, start the clean up commits after \texttt{master} branch.

I check each commits, if there is more than single logical change, I split them.

If I have multiple commits related to a single logical change, I rename the title of those commits.

Then I rearrange the commits such that commits related to a logical change are group together.

Finally I Combine multiple commits into a single commit.
